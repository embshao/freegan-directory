    "description": "Wichcraft (397 Greenwich St)\n\nAt the end of the night, the restaurant Wichcraft throws away between 10-20 sandwiches which were made earlier in the day. They are all cold sandwiches (goat cheese, chicken salad, chickpea, tuna) and can be eaten or stored for a few days. If you go after closing (around 8:30pm on weekdays and 5:30pm on weekends) they will probably happily give you a bag of sandwiches. There are 10 others around the city. Confirmed 3/5/2012.",
